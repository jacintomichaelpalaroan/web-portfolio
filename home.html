	Values

Learning is something that is important to me since it improves our understanding of the things we do not understand. It develops ourselves to be better in the field that we choose.

Optimism brings the color and joy in our life. I choose to look on the positive side no matter what and be happy.

Teamwork and coordinating with others is essential to me to achieve a goal in a timely and orderly manner. 

Perseverance is what hold when times gets tough. I choose to take in the work no matter how difficult it may be to achieve my goals.
